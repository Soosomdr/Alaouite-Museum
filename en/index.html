                <h2>Idris I</h2>
                <p>Idris I, founder of the Idrisid dynasty, is regarded as the founding father of Morocco. Born in the 8th century, he fled the Hejaz region due to the Battle of Fakhkh and established himself in northern Morocco. In 788, he founded the city of FÃ¨s, which became a significant center of Islamic culture and learning. His reign marked the beginning of the first Islamic dynasty in Morocco, laying the foundation for the nation's identity.</p>
